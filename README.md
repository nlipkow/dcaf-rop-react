# UI for Configuration of Server Authorization Managers (Resource Overseeing Principal)



## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)
- Go to `localhost:3000`

**Note:** You can only use the functionality of the UI with a running SAM [see here](https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/WADI-Bachelor/dcaf-java).
 
To change the host and/or port of SAM, change the respective attributes in the `.env` file.
